<h2>Hi there! I'm Carlos.</h2>

I'm a Software Engineering student focused on the .NET ecosystem and web development.

I'm currently studying and building projects using C#, ASP.NET, Blazor, React, SQL Server, and Azure. I'm familiar with tools like Entity Framework, Dapper, and Docker, and I'm constantly improving my problem-solving skills and data modeling abilities (SQL).

I also have knowledge in UI/UX design and agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, which I apply in both academic and personal projects.
